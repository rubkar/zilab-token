            <p class="light-text">JavaScript is also used in environments that arenâ€™t web-based, such as
              PDF documents, site-specific browsers, and desktop widgets. Newer and faster JavaScript
              virtual machines (VMs) and platforms built upon them have also increased the popularity
              of JavaScript for server-side web applications. On the client side, JavaScript has been
              traditionally implemented as an interpreted language, but more recent browsers perform
              just-in-time compilation.</p>
